      <p>The project is an implementation of a multiple choice trivia game.  There's only four questions included, but since they're stored as a JavaScript hash, more questions can easily be added.</p>
      <p>The implementation is in JavaScript and JQuery, alongside HTML and CSS.</p>
      <p>To summarize how the project works, the questions are stored as a hash, consisting of</p>
      <ol class="alphalist">
        <li>the question itself</li>
        <li>a list of answers, with one having a "correct" flag</li>
        <li>a score for the question</li>
        <li>an optional image to be displayed with the question</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The program goes through the list of questions in order. The order of answers is randomized each time, so the first answer one time might be the third another time.</p>
      <p>It listens for a click on one of the answers. If the answer is correct, the score for the question is added to the user's score. If it's wrong, one point is subtracted, though the score cannot drop below zero.</p>
      <p>Once the code reaches the last question, it repeats that question perpetually.</p>
      <p>This could easily be made into a more serious quiz. More questions could be added.</p>
      <p>A large increase in the number of questions would require a database of questions. I'd like to add that in the future, and also add things like allowing the user to select categories and difficulty. Beyond that, a database would allow persistent scoring with user logins.<p/>
      <p>Still more details can be found in the project's <a href="https://github.com/arthuradams/not-jeopardy">README file</a>.</p>

      <p>One of our assignments for the course was to explore an API of our choosing. One of our instructors suggested the API for <a href="http://ineedaprompt.com/">INeedAPrompt</a>, a website he created to generate random characters and situations.</p>
      <p>I explored the site and its API, and found it amused me greatly. It reminded me of an old joke that you can take descriptions of two utterly bizarre characters, add "togethet, they're detectives!", and it creates the plot of a TV show. (TVTropes calls the concept <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyFightCrime">They Fight Crime</a>.</p>
      <p>The interface is very simple. There are ten pull-downs, each allowing the user to select one of the five types of items (adjective, noun, adverb, verb, location) the API returns.</p>
      <p>Each time a selector is changed, the "plot description" in the top box regenerates. I realize that, from a user interface perspective, the automatic regeneration is annoying, to say the least. From a technical standpoint, though, getting it to work was a nice challenge. I would like to add a button that will allow the user to just press a seprate button to regenerate.</p>
      <p>Eventually, I would like to fork the <a href="https://github.com/RobertAKARobin/inap-node">INeedAPrompt source code</a>, strip it down to just the core that generates the prompts, and rewrite it to male it my own. This serves several purposes:</p>
      <ol class="alphalist">
        <li>It allows me to keep working on, and learning from, a project that has brought my amusement. I'll probably convert it to a different language.</li>
        <li>I won't be dedendent on a web site maintained by someone else to keep my project working.</li>
        <li>I will be able to host the application at a secure site. When I attempted to host it in my github.io space, I was unable to connect to the API, since it is hosted at a non-secure site.</p>
      </ol>

  <tr><th colspan="2">Personal Web Site</th></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>This site, in other words. It's all HTML, CSS and a little JavaScript/JQuery. The scripting covers one thing -- this is all done as one page, with the menu executing a script that changes the body of the page.</p>
      <p>This demonstrates my philosophy of web design. While I am much more of a developer than a designer, I prefer web sites to be simple, even spartan. This is a personal bias, dating back to a time when I was using a dial-up connection on a somewhat defective modem. Overly complex sites were slow to load, and I came to prefer simplicity. I think <a href="https://craigslist.org/">craigslist</a> and <a href="http://www.drudgereport.com/">The Drudge Report</a> are good style models.</p>
      <p>That aside, I do have an engineer's curiosity and desire to learn, so I've added a few "Easter Eggs". For instance, try hovering the mouse pointer over my portrait in the upper right. I'll add more later.</p>

      <p>The actual hosting of this page is on github, at <a href="http://arthuradams.github.io/">arthuradams.github.io</a>.</p>
      <p>It can also be accessed at <a href="http://arthurcadams.com/">arthurcadams.com</a>. That's a redirect via godaddy to the github site. godaddy is providing masking so the URL for that stays arthurcadams.com. godaddy's masking adds HTML that validators show as non-compliant.</p>
