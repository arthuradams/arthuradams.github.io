<h3\>Who am I?</h3>
       <p>I have worked in software development for over two decades. My degree
         is in Electrical Engineering, but my first professional job involved
         supporting a <skill><a href="http://www.cadence.com/en/default.aspx"
           target="_blank">Microelectronics Computer-Aided Design System</a></skill>.
           This lead to a
          transition into software development, eventually spending several year
          in various positions supporting Software Configuration Management
          (tools such as <skill><a href="https://subversion.apache.org">Subversion</a></skill>
            and <skill><a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/en/clearcase">
              Rational ClearCase</a></skill>).
        </p>
        <p>
          In May of 2016, I began a <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/education/web-development-immersive">twelve week immersive web development program
